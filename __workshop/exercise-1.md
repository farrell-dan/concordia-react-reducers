# Exercise 1: Adding dependencies

For this project, we'll use the following dependencies:

- `@tippyjs/react`
- `@mui/material` 
- `@emotion/react `
- `@emotion/styled`
- `react-icons-kit`
- `styled-components`

> the `@` in front of most of these package names are called a _namespace_ â€“ they allow package authors to group multiple packages under the same "domain"

Install all of these packages with `yarn add`. You can chain them together with a space, to do it all in 1 command:

```bash
yarn add package-1 package-2 package-3 ...
```
