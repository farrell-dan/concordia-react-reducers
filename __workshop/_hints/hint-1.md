Update the `useEffect` in `App` to call `receiveSeatInfoFromServer` with the data:

```diff
const {
    actions: { receiveSeatInfoFromServer },
} = useContext(SeatContext);

useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/seat-availability')
        .then(res => res.json())
    -     .then(data => console.log(data));
    +     .then(data => receiveSeatInfoFromServer(data));
}, []);
```

Inside the reducer, we want to produce a new state that matches the shape of the `initialState`, using the data available.

If we add a `console.log` to our reducer, here's what we get:

```js
const initialState = {
    hasLoaded: false,
    seats: null,
    numOfRows: 0,
    seatsPerRow: 0,
};

const reducer = (state, action) => {
    console.log(action);
    /*
    Logs:

    {
        type: 'receive-seat-info-from-server',
        seats: // big object full of seats
        numOfRows: 8,
        seatsPerRow: 12,
    }
    */
}
```

This looks an awful lot like the data we already have, in initialState!

Let's add a `switch`, and copy over the relevant bits:

```diff
const reducer = (state, action) => {
- // TODO
+ switch (action.type) {
+   case 'receive-seat-info-from-server': {
+     return {
+       ...state,
+       hasLoaded: true,
+       seats: action.seats,
+       numOfRows: action.numOfRows,
+       seatsPerRow: action.seatsPerRow,
+     };
+   }
+
+   default:
+     throw new Error(`Unrecognized action: ${action.type}`);
+ }
}
```

When `dispatch` is called with the `'receive-seat-info-from-server'` action, we want to return a new state, which updates:

- The `hasLoaded` state, from `false` to `true` (since we just finished getting our data!)
- The `seats`, `numOfRows`, and `seatsPerRow` that we got from the server.

We've done a lot of work so far, and not much in the UI is visible! By checking `console.log`, we should have _some_ confidence that what we're doing is right, but let's actually add some stuff to the DOM.

Inside `App`, let's also pull some more data out of context, and render it:

```diff
const App = () => {
    const {
    +   state: { numOfRows },
        actions: { receiveSeatInfoFromServer },
    } = useContext(SeatContext);

    useEffect(() => {
        fetch('/api/seat-availability')
        .then(res => res.json())
        .then(data => receiveSeatInfoFromServer(data));
    }, []);

    return (
        <>
        <GlobalStyles />
    -     TODO: Build stuff!
    +     This venue has {numOfRows} rows!
        </>
    );
}
```
